    <description>Package for common Redirect rules.
Meant for Umbraco sites, but can be used on any site with Rewrite Module for IIS.
Features that makes is package great.
• No 301 chaining. You only redirect once, no matter how many things are wrong with the URL.
• Topdomains are enforced with prefixed www.
• Subdomains are enforced with no prefix of www.
• Whitelist of urls that are not meant to be transformed. This is meant for API's, Ajax calls or backend framework such as Umbraco.

Known issues:
• Domains with additional punctuation marks won't work as expected, unless as a subdomain.
• Domains such as mysite.co.uk won't work as expected because of the additional punctuation mark is counted as a subdomain.</description>
